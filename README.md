# Streaming Nike&Adidas Sentiment on Twitter Using R
This is an ad-hoc attempt to measure the sentiment of tweets on Nike and Adidas respectively, through Twitter streaming API, using R.
1. set up your account in Twitter Development, create a new application
2. With reference to the Stream template file, set up your Oauth key for authentification.
3. Then you can directly run the stream file by executing the command line "R script Stream_Adidas.R" and "R script Stream_Nike.R" at two separate terminals. The streaming would run infinitely until you stop it, or you reach a streaming limit set by Twitter API
4. Then run the working file to check the graphical and tabular visualization of the sentiment data.
